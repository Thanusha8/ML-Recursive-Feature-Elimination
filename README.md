# ML-Recursive-Feature-Elimination
ML feature selection using RFE and RFECV methods

This project demonstrates feature selection using **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** and **Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV)** on the Boston Housing dataset. The goal is to identify the most important features for predicting house prices using linear regression.

## Methods
1. **RFE**: Selects top `n` features based on model coefficients.
2. **RFECV**: Uses cross-validation to determine the optimal number of features automatically.

## Results
- RFE selected 7 features
- RFECV selected 5 features
